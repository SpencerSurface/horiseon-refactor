# Horiseon Refactor

## Description

This project is a refactor of the code of a webpage belonging to an SEO company named Horiseon. The reason for the refactor was to increase the SEO of the page, as well as to make it more accessible. Some of the specific means used to achieve this included replacing the extensive use of div elements in the document with more semantic elements, adding a meaningful page title, and adding alt attributes to the image elements. Additionally, messy CSS was cleaned up and commented to make it easier to understand.

In completing this project, I learned that making a webpage more accessible can have broader benefits as well. For example, using semantic HTML elements instead of only divs not only should make it easier for screen readers to interpret the page, but it also makes it easier as a developer to understand what is happening in the HTML code.

## Credits

This project consists primarily of code refactored from files provided by edX Boot Camps LLC. edX was the source of the initial index.html and style.css files, as well as the source of the images other than the screenshot of the completed page. This README file was created by myself, and all modifications to the code were done by me.
